# 🚀 Welcome to my Neovim configuration repository!

This repository contains all of the configuration files and plugins that I use to power my Neovim editor. I've tried to carefully curate a collection of plugins and settings that improve my productivity and make my development workflow smoother.

Whether you're a seasoned Neovim user or just getting started, I hope that you can find something useful in this repository. Feel free to use and customize these configuration files to suit your own needs.

### 💡 A few highlights of my configuration include:

- A beautiful and minimal color scheme (One Dark)
- A set of handy navigation and editing shortcuts
- A collection of plugins for linting, formatting, and code completion
- I'm always looking for ways to improve my configuration, so if you have any suggestions or find any issues, please don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request!

🙏🏼 Happy coding! 🙏🏼
